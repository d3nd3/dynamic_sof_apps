description: RMF control element <stm> to start/end a menu page; one per file
---

### When to use
- Wrap all parsable RMF content between `<stm>` and `</stm>`.
- Only one pair per `.rmf` file; anything outside is ignored.

### Options (inside <stm>)
- `nopush` — do not push page on stack; cannot be revisited.
- `waitanim` — block input until ghoul animations finish.
- `fragile` — any keypress exits this screen.
- `global` — disable default scissoring (page draws outside frame bounds).
- `command <cmd>` — execute before creating the page.
- `resize <width> <height>` — resize current frame and center it.

### Example
```text
<stm nopush command "exec menus/setup" resize 640 480>
  <frame default 640 480 page main>
</stm>
```
